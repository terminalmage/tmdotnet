Tommorow I'll be flying out to Los Angeles for
[SCaLE12x](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x). I'll be [giving a
lightning
talk](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/presentations/if-you-give-programmer-cookie)
at [UpSCALE](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/upscale) on Friday night,
and manning the [SaltStack](http://saltstack.com) booth on Saturday and Sunday.
[SaltStack](http://saltstack.com) community member Cory Quinn will be giving
his own talk at [UpSCALE](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/upscale),
titled [You Are All
Idiots](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/presentations/you-are-all-idiots).
I'm definitely looking forward to seeing it, Corey is delightfully abrasive and
always entertaining.

If you're out on the expo floor, come say hi and get some swag!
