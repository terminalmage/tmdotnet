Summary: I've switched from WordPress to Pelican!

I haven't managed my WordPress site in over a year. I never really liked
WordPress, I'm not a big fan of web-based WYSIWYG editors. A co-worker of mine
recommended [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) to me, and I've been very pleased
with it so far. Being able to write blog posts in markdown, and having a
website that doesn't rely on a database were top priorities, and Pelican gives
me both of those. Also, it's written in Python, which makes it much more
attractive to me than other options like [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)
(which seems to be abandonware anyway). I plan plenty of content in the coming
weeks, including a write-up on how I am managing the site's content using
[GitHub](https://github.com) and [SaltStack](http://saltstack.com).

I'm looking forward to having a much easier-to-maintain site.
