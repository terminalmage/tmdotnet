[Google Voice](https://www.google.com/voice/) provides a voicemail feature with
a useful (if often comically inaccurate) transcription feature. The way in
which one normally enables this feature is to dial a series of digits which
instructs the cell provider to forward missed calls to an alternate number.
However, for [Ting](https://ting.com/) this is not supported, at least not on
all devices.

The workaround is simple, though not widely advertised; forwarding must be
configured from the [Ting](https://ting.com/) Dashboard. The steps to do this
are as follows:

1. Go to the [Device Settings](https://ting.com/account/devices) page.
2. Click the appropriate device.
3. In the "Minutes" section, check the **Forward 'busy signal' calls to this
   number** and **Forward 'no answer' calls to this number** checkboxes, and
   enter your Google Voice number in both corresponding input boxes.

I also unchecked the **Voicemail** box since I wasn't going to be using Ting
voicemail, but this is probably not necessary.
